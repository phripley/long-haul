	<p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-ripley/">Peter Ripley!</a></p>
	<p>I was on staff at BMI for 12 years and consulted there for many years before that.  I loved having the mission at BMI of helping creative people lead a creative life (Royalties for Songwriters, ka-ching!).</p>

	<p>I worked as the tech lead in the BMI Marketing Communications department and had a hand in many (most?) digital inititives over the years.</p>

	<p>While I don't work at BMI any longer I do feel like I have a lot of knowledge to share with folks in the industry, especially songwriters.</p>

	<p>Everything in this blog in my own opinion and not that of my former employer.</p>

	<p>If you have questions please <a href="/contact/">reach out</a>.</p>
